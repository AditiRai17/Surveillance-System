# Surveillance-System

This code represents the foundation of a Surveillance System, which can be a highly valuable and versatile project for various practical applications. It leverages an array of technology stacks and libraries to enable real-time face detection through a webcam feed, making it a sophisticated and practical solution for security and monitoring needs.

## Technology Stacks Utilized:

### OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): 
    OpenCV serves as the backbone of this project, providing powerful tools for image and video analysis.
    It's employed for real-time face detection, a critical component in security and surveillance applications.

### Python: 
    The code is written in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language that is both easy to understand and work with.

### argparse: 
    The argparse library is employed for parsing command-line arguments, providing users with the flexibility to specify parameters 
    like the file extension for image storage and the output video file.

### os (Operating System Interface): 
    The os library is used to interact with the operating system, facilitating tasks like listing files in the current directory and managing file operations.
